# Apple Store Spider

February 10th, 2018

The [store_spider.py](cc9431/Apple-Store-Spider/blob/master/Canopy/spiders/store_spider.py) file runs on python 3.6, and uses Scrapy 1.5.0 and googlemaps (Python client for Google API). This spider will scrape information from the webpage "https://www.apple.com/retail/storelist/" and return a json file containing relevant information on all 501 Apple stores.

Output can be found in [sites.json](cc9431/Apple-Store-Spider/blob/master/sites.json)

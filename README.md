February 10th, 2018

The store_spider.py file runs on python 3.6, and uses Scrapy 1.5.0 and googlemaps (Python client for Google API). This spider will scrape information from the webpage "https://www.apple.com/retail/storelist/" and return a json file containing relevant information on all 501 Apple stores.
